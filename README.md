# Next.js CMS Blog app

Simple blog with full content management solution from graphCMS. This project uses graphQL query language (it's my first time using it), and tailwind for style.

## Run 

After creating your own graph cms data and replacing my credentials with you own, run

```js
npm i
npm run dev
```
